# Description
I wanted to play Momir Vig Basic in person, so I made this.

# TODOs
* Make better README
* Make README and repo have RaspberryPI configuration
* Make RaspberryPI capable of connecting to a network while also serving the website
* Add set, artist and rarity to Card object and print out
* Fix related card code? Something bad is happening and not sure why
* Give receipt printer info
* Make alchemy cards work properly (in my head separate from related cards because they're not necessarily marked as related in scryfall)
* (Non-code) get smaller receipt paper and make cards conjured rather than tokens
* Fix card code to not jinja out json (I forgot that this didn't have to be the way)
* Get art on cards? Somehow? (not sure feasible)
* Comment code
* Make website track life as well
